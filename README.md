# Time-series-analysis

Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. In time series analysis, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly.
data is collected at a regular interval of time. Then this data is analyzed for future forecasting. All the data collected is dependent on time which is also our only variable.

Understanding data Another benefit of time series analysis is that it can help an analyst to better understand a data set. This is because of the models used in time series analysis help to interpret the true meaning of the data, as touched on previously.

In time series analysis, time is a significant variable of the data. Times series analysis helps us study our world and learn how we progress within it. What is time series analysis? Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time.



We applied all the time series models including LSTM,Prphet,ARIMA
But the prediction looks good in case of prphet. 
Hence we deploy model using prophet in streamlit.
